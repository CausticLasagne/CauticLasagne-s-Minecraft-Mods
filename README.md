--- CausticLasagne's Minecraft Mods ---
---------------------------------------

Now with Less Salt!

I am Caustic Lasagne and i am a slightly seasoned programmer.

I make my own games with unity and also play Minecraft a lot with mods.

I am deciding to make my own mods to run on my own server so i don't have to put up
with everyone's erroring mods.

My mods are made properly following the Java Programming Convention and use try and catch
statements to cancel code instead of throwing an unhandled exeption and crashing minecraft.

I mainly use my mods on my server but I decided to publish them to the community.

Eventually someone will post more youtube videoes or tutorials to make better mods
or even mods with crops, gui's, moving blocks and other stuff so mine get better.

Well I hope you enjoy the mods I make and may they bring you hours of enjoyment
and multiplayer fun.
